# adventofcode
Playing with http://adventofcode.com/ in Python. Also an excuse to work on a project with tmux and vim as my only
workflow tools.

## Getting up and running

### Dependencies
* A copy of the Python version specified in `.python-version` (along with a copy of `virtualenv`). Or just install [`pyenv`](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv).
* `tmux` (`brew install tmux`)

### Starting up the dev environment

To start up the multi-window tmux environment (via [`tmuxp`](https://github.com/tony/tmuxp)):

    make start
